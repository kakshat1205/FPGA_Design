## Using Cyclone 4 Lets design a microprocessor JARVIS 2.0 beta(J2b)

-Our FPGA-based 8-bit processor designed using the VHDL language mainly consists of 4 4-bit registers, a 16-word memory with 8-bit words, a control unit, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU)
-Dedicated ISA(Instruction Set architecture) is being developed for J2b
-Have to design a assembler for J2b
