## Altera Cyclone IV EP4CE10E22C8N
Will be using altera Cyclone IV which is awesome for beginners purpose
It is programmed using quartus prime lite which do not need any licence and is quite easy to use
I considered some Xilinx based FPGAs as well but Vivado was comparitivly bigger in size and i am used to environment of quartus
Before bying a FPGA I recommend you you see the specs and consider if it matches your application or not
Many open source FPGAs are also available other than these 2, one of the in ICQ Sugar which can be used with Lattice ICE whicch is opensource and quite easy.


Problem faced while installing driver for usb buster in Windows 10, Run windows in test mode to solve the issue.
